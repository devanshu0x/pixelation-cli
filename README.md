# Pixelation-cli
A simple cli to pixelate a png image.
***
Pixelation is used to reduce an image's detail by enlarging individual pixels or groups of pixels so that each group represents a larger, uniform color block.
This results in a blocky, mosaic-like look, where small details are lost, and the image appears coarser. It gives picture retro games like effect.
